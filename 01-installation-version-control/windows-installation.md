# Python Installation

This tutorial will go over how to install CPython on **Windows**. 

### Download CPython
Download CPython from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). As noted in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) (Fig 1), Python 3.12 is the latest stable version. Thus, you should download Python **3.12**, which is also the automatic recommendation on the download page (Fig 2).

### Install CPython
Click on the download .exe file and check the **add path.exe to PATH** box at the bottom (Fig 3). Then follow the instructions prompted to install CPython.

Upon completing the installation, the executable file that launches Python is typically located in the `AppData\Local\Programs` directory. This directory is commonly used for storing executables installed by the user. Running the commands cd `AppData\Local\Programs\Python` followed by `ls` in Windows PowerShell shows that the Python 3.12 directory is indeed inside `AppData\Local\Programs` (Fig 4). You can also see that I had also installed Python 3.11 before.

Once you `cd Python312` and then `ls`, youâ€™ll find that `python3.exe` is the executable that comes with the installation.
